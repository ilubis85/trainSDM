\title{Compute Signed Distance to a Polygon Area (Positive Inside, Negative Outside)}
\usage{
dist2area(poly, res = 30, buffer = 1000, crs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{poly}{An \code{sf} or \code{SpatVector} polygon object representing the area of interest (e.g., forest).}

\item{res}{Numeric. Spatial resolution (in map units) for the output raster. Default = 30.}

\item{buffer}{Optional numeric. Buffer distance (in map units) to extend the raster extent beyond
the polygon for distance computation. Default = 1000.}

\item{crs}{Optional coordinate reference system (EPSG code or PROJ string).
If \code{NULL}, uses CRS of \code{poly}.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} where values:
\itemize{
\item are \strong{positive} inside the polygon (increasing toward the center),
\item are \strong{negative} outside the polygon (decreasing away from the border),
\item are \strong{0} along the polygon boundary.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates a continuous raster of signed distances relative to
a polygon area (e.g., a forest patch). Distances are \strong{positive inside} the polygon
and \strong{negative outside}, with 0 representing the boundary. Internally, it creates
a polyline from the polygon boundary, computes distance inside and outside, and
merges them into a single raster.

# Example polygon (e.g., forest patch)
p <- st_as_sf(as.polygons(ext(0, 1000, 0, 1000)))
p_buff <- st_buffer(p, 100)

# Compute distance map
dist_map <- dist2area(p_buff, res = 10)
