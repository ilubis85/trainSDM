\title{Generate Regular Grid (Fishnet) from a Spatial Object}
\usage{
makeGrids(spObject, cellSize, clip = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{spObject}{A spatial object (sf, SpatVector, or Spatial*) in projected coordinates (e.g., UTM).}

\item{cellSize}{Numeric. Grid cell size (width and height) in the same units as the spatial object's CRS (usually meters).}

\item{clip}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, only cells intersecting the spatial object are kept.
If \code{FALSE}, the full rectangular grid covering the object's extent is returned. Default = \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object representing the generated grid polygons with a column \code{Grid_id}
containing unique IDs for each cell.
}
\description{
This function creates a regular grid (fishnet) of polygon cells over the
extent of a given spatial object. Optionally, the grid can be clipped to
match the boundary of the spatial object.
}
\details{
This function is particularly useful for spatial analyses that require dividing
a landscape into regular subunits, such as habitat suitability modeling,
biodiversity surveys, or spatial summarization.

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(terra)
library(sf)

# Example polygon (extent of interest)
poly <- sf::st_as_sf(as.polygons(ext(100000, 105000, 0, 5000), crs = "EPSG:32748"))

# Create 1 km grid covering polygon
grids <- makeGrids(poly, cellSize = 1000, clip = TRUE)

plot(grids["Grid_id"])
